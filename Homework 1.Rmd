```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## C=0
```{r c}
source('~/Desktop/qscript.R')
x <- seq(from=-10, to=10, by=.5)
y <- quad(x,a=1,b=1)
plot(x,y)
```
First we tested quadratics with C=0.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
